# Averi Assets Open Source

Averi Assets Open Source is a project by me, to provide users of /chick-fil-a/ with free to use and open source averi content. This includes but is not limited to 3d models and 2d sprites. You may use these for the purpose of animation, creation of games, and so on, with no restrictions.

# Minecraft Averi
This model of Averi is made with Blockbench to make Averi look like she is in Minecraft. ![](./minecraft.gif) 

## Files
All files can be found inside of the ``minecraft folder`` in the root of the repo.
